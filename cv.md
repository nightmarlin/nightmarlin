## About

I'm a Go Engineer with TypeScript experience, specialising in distributed
backend technologies.

I studied Software Engineering at Lancaster University from 2019-2022, and in
2020 took on a role as an Intern at WalkUp - which became a part-time role
accompanying my studies and has now evolved into a Full-Time role as a Backend
Engineer at Dojo. I love thinking about systems architecture and sharing my
thoughts with my fellow engineers - even if they don't always pan out we often
learn something new!

## Previous Experience

- [Dojo](https://dojo.tech/) \[Jul 2020 - Present\]

  > Intern -> Jr. Backend Engineer -> Backend Engineer

  At Dojo I've developed my skills working as an Engineer within a team, my
  understanding of distributed systems & their challenges, and how to bring an
  idea from concept to product!

  Notable achievements include:

  - Migrating core services to use more appropriate database technologies
  - Leading documentation efforts to make a codebase that once was understood by
    up to four engineers at a time accessible to technical & non-technical parts
    of the entire organisation
  - Rearchitecting core services to an improved structure to make them easier to
    build upon and test
  - Developing the first iterations of Bookings, which has become a major
    offering of the service and allowed us to keep key customers
  - Development of features to help to bring the platform through 2020 and the
    COVID-19 pandemic amid rapidly-changing guidelines and requirements for both
    us and our customers

- [Costa Coffee](https://www.costa.co.uk/) \[2017 - 2020\]

  > Barista

  My first proper job (before this I was a paperboy!) taught me fundamentals for
  good teamwork, communication, and work-life balance! I also gained an
  appreciation for the ability to follow key processes to ensure customer
  health, safety, and success!

## Volunteering

- Lancaster University LGBTQ+ Forum Executive \[Jan '21 - Jul '22\]

  > General Secretary

  This role was primarily administrative; focused on enabling my fellow Officers
  to succeed in their duties by managing day-to-day paperwork and
  business-as-usual affairs. My responsibilities included:

  - Managing the Forum's budget
  - Tracking the ongoing work of Forum Officers and ensuring they haven't got
    too much on their plate
  - Producing risk assessments
  - Minuting Exec meetings and distributing those to the wider membership
  - Updating and rewriting our handover documentation to help make the
    transition into the role easier for new Officers

  In my time in the role I was also able to introduce new approaches to workload
  management that I'd learned from my position at Dojo, which successfully
  reduced stress and made it easier for Officers to step back when their course
  demanded it.

- Lancaster University LGBTQ+ Forum Executive \[Nov '21 - Jan '22\]

  > Men's+ Welfare Officer

  This role provides support and information for LGBTQ+ students who
  identify as male or non-binary through campaigns, weekly welfare hours, and
  signposting.

  In the role, I successfully ran a HIV awareness campaign aimed at reducing
  stigma and sharing information about PrEP (preventative medication). I also
  organised a talk from the CEO of Out In The Bay (one of Lancaster's leading
  LGBT+ support charities) for university members to attend as part of this.

- Bowland College JCR \[May '20 - Nov '20\]

  > Publicity Officer

  My primary role was to work with other JCR members to produce accessible
  graphics for our social media pages, however I also assisted with organising
  welcome week 2020 and a variety of COVID-safe events for new students.

## Technologies

In order of proficiency:

- Go
- TypeScript (& JS)
- SQL
  > Primarily PostgreSQL
- Microservices
- Google Cloud Platform
  > Specifically: SQL, K8S Engine, Logging, Firebase and IAM
- Docker

## Skills

## Outside Interests

These don't help with employment opportunities, but a it's nice to have things
you want to share with people - a good work-life balance is important!

- LGBTQ+ Advocacy

  I care a lot about providing and/or facilitating LGBTQ+-friendly spaces, and
  making sure members of my community have access to as much information and
  resources as they can.

- Cycling
- Hollow Knight, PokÃ©mon & Celeste

## Education

- Lancaster University \[2019 - 2022\]

  > BSc Software Engineering - First Class with Honours.

  My time at Lancaster allowed me to study a variety of topics within the
  degree, with my favourite modules being Distributed Systems, Embedded Systems,
  Languages & Compilation, and the three main Group Projects.

  While I'm no frontender, a module from my very first year - LICA140
  "Introduction to Design" was a functional education in understanding your
  users and how you design what you build. While it focused heavily on physical
  design, it still informs how I think about APIs and usability.

- Bournemouth School for Boys \[2017 - 2019\]

  > A-Level Physics: A

  > A-Level Mathematics (with Statistics & Mechanics): A
  >
  > A-Level Computer Science: B

- Bournemouth School for Boys \[2012 - 2017\]

  > Passes in GCSE English Literature, English Language and Mathematics.
