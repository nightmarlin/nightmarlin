## Aloha ðŸ’™

I'm Lewis (He/Him), a combination Backend Developer, Software Engineering student and cycling
enthusiast. I currently work at [WalkUp](https://walkup.co/), creating a queue-free dining
experience through the power of Go and TypeScript! I recently graduated (Software Engineering,
BSC First Class Hons.) from [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/), learning new
skills, helping to run our LGBTQ+ Forum and trying very hard not to get mad at C/Java (and failing).

I'm always looking to learn new things and am currently working on my understanding of Kubernetes,
Docker and GCP!
