## Aloha, I'm Lewis

> He / Him 🏳️‍🌈

A combination Backend Developer, Software Engineering graduate and mild Cycling
enthusiast. I currently work at [Dojo](https://dojo.tech/) as a Backend
Engineer - powering virtual queues, bookings, and other restaurant-y goodness
using Go (and a dash of TypeScript)!

I recently graduated (Software Engineering, BSc First Class Hons.) from
[Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/software-engineering-bsc-hons-g602/)
where I studied C, Java (against my will I promise), and various other
technologies. Highlights include:

- LICA 140: Introduction to Design
- SCC 211: Operating Systems
- SCC 369: Embedded Systems
- SCC 230, 330 & 331: Group projects

I'm always looking to learn new things and am currently working on my
understanding of Kubernetes, Docker and GCP!

While my full CV can be found [here](./cv.md), I'm not currently looking for new
employment opportunites - but if you work with something cool and interesting,
give it a read and reach out anyways!

> I prefer not to do contracting/agency work.
